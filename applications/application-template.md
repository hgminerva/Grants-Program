## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

​The Humidefi serves as a pivotal hub in the world of decentralized finance, offering a dynamic ecosystem centered around two core components: UMI, our native token, and PHPU, a meticulously collateralized stablecoin pegged to the Philippine Peso. What sets Humidefi apart is its robust support for Smart Contracts, which serves as a catalyst for empowering software engineers to effortlessly embark on their journey into the realm of Web3.0 app development. Our mission is to not only redefine financial paradigms but also foster an environment where innovation thrives and where everyone, from developers to users, can actively participate in shaping the future of decentralized finance

### Overview

As a decentralized finance hub, it enables you

- Buy Cryptocurrency – You will have a the ability to buy UMI and PHPU using facilities like Transak and GCash.
-Pay in Cryptocurrency – You pay directly anywhere your suppliers. You could even pay bills, utilities, and taxes.
- Invest with Cryptocurrency – With UMI, you can invest in staking pools or even Parachains and Parathreads. We are also going to create a loan facility for PHPU.
- Swap between Cryptocurrencies – Swapping different currency cost a lot due to Forex fees, with Humidefi, you can swap with almost no fees.
-Redeem your stable coin to local currency - With PHPU, you can withdraw anytime using any partner banks and payment facilities.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Blockchain 
We will be using Substrate. At the start we will be using a modified Proof-of-Authority (PoA) which rewards the known validators for authoring a block. We will add Smart Contract support to the Blockchain.

-Stable Coin (PHPU)
One of the pillars of a decentralized finance application is the stable coin. We will be making a collateralized stable coin peg to the Philippine Pesos. 
Creating a virtual asset in the Philippines requires investment, hence, we will be partnering with local banks to make this happen.
- Applications (UI)
In order for user faster adaptation we will be building a UI that can be used on the web and in mobile devices. Our UI will focus on the features and integration to other applications to provide a smooth transition process of converting local currency to Cryptocurrency.

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
We will provide UI for blockchain transparency, e.g., scanner, blockchain monitoring, validator node management, etc. These application is very important to not just the users who wants total transparency but also to developers trying to understand how a Blockchain works.
We are also going to build a stable coin inventory and accounting system, this will empower the virtual asset holder to manage the Cryptocurrency efficiently




### Ecosystem Fit

The Humidefi embodies a dynamic ecosystem, comprising five essential components, each contributing to the vision of creating a more inclusive and interconnected world of decentralized finance." Certainly, here are five essential components of the Humidefi ecosystem:


-  Financial Inclusion: By pegging PHPU to the Philippine Peso and offering accessible DeFi services, Humidefi can contribute to greater financial inclusion, allowing individuals in the Philippines and beyond to access banking and financial services that may have been previously out of reach.

- Smart Contract Development: Humidefi's support for Smart Contracts opens the door for developers, especially those new to Web3.0 app development, to easily create and deploy decentralized applications, contributing to the growth of the DeFi developer community.
- Stablecoin Adoption: The adoption of PHPU, a stablecoin pegged to a fiat currency, can encourage more people to enter the DeFi space with a stable and reliable digital currency, thereby contributing to the overall stability and liquidity of the DeFi ecosystem.

- Governance Participation: Humidefi's community-driven governance model empowers token holders to actively participate in decision-making processes, setting a precedent for decentralized governance and promoting greater user involvement across the broader DeFi landscape.

  -Interoperability and Collaboration: Through partnerships and cross-chain integration, Humidefi can foster greater interoperability with other DeFi projects and blockchain networks, contributing to a more interconnected and collaborative DeFi ecosystem that benefits users and stakeholders across different platforms.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/docs/RFPs) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality
